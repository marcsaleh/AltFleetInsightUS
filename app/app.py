    **AltFleet Insight** helps U.S. Medium and Heavy-Duty Vehicle (MHDV) operators assess the **economic and environmental impact** of alternative fuel technologies using a **one-to-one replacement strategy** for **small-scale deployments**, not full fleet transitions.

    ### üîπ **What the Tool Does**
    ‚úÖ **Covers multiple fuel types**  
    - Supports **diesel, biodiesel (B20), renewable diesel (R99), and battery electric** across all applications.  
    - Includes **gasoline, diesel hybrid, CNG, RNG, and hydrogen fuel cell** for applicable vehicle types where data is available.  

    ‚úÖ **Cost & emissions insights**  
    - Calculates **cumulative net present value (NPV) costs** over a vehicle‚Äôs lifetime.  
    - Estimates **well-to-wheel GHG emissions** and **tailpipe NOx and PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ for air quality impact**.  
    - If NPV is **higher than baseline fuel**, estimates **$ per ton of GHG saved**.
